Auditory lexical desicion with auditory priming.

Experiment:
	Auditory lexical decision task with auditory semantic prime 

Description:
	The purpose of this experiment is to measure how quickly and accurately
	participants can classify stimuly as words or nonwords. For each trial
	a pair of words is presented auditorily: a semantic prime word and a
	target word. Participant's task is to classify the target word either as 
	word or nonwords. To respond the participant hits a yes-button if they
	think the target word is a word, or the no-button if they think the target
	word is a non-word. Auto-paced, with an inter-stimulis interval (ISI) of
	300 ms between the prime and the target. Output: RT and correctness.


In this folder you will find:
	- the 'stimuli' folder which contains the wav files (768 wavs) to be used 
	in the experiment
	- 4 csv files, each one correspondong to a different stimuli list


Instruction to participants: 
 	"<b>Dear participant,</b>\n"
                "\n"
                "Thank you for participating in this experiment.\n"
                "\n"
                "You are now going to hear words over the headphones, one "
                "after the other. The words come in pairs. Your task is to "
                "indicate, as quickly as possible, whether the you think "
                "<i>the second word is a real Dutch word or not</i>. "
                "Try to make no mistakes.\n"
                "\n"

                "To respond, hit the left button on the button-box for "
                "<i>No</i> and the right button for <i>Yes</i>.\n"
